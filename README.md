# Customer-classification-RFM

Customer lifetime value prediction using Deep learning techniques:
The aim of the project is to use deep learning, particularly recurrent neural networks to better understand customer behaviour in the retail sector.
To achieve this, I implemented different RNN models to predict customers' lifetime value using the RFM parameters ( well known parameters in marketing ).
The dataset used to train and test the model is available on kaggle :
